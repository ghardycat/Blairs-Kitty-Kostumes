# Blair's Kitty Kostumes — Static Website

This is a whimsical, static site for a pretend brand that sells cat costumes and offers "How to Be a Cat" lessons.

## Files
- `index.html` — Home/landing
- `shop.html` — Product grid with a simple email-based checkout cart
- `lessons.html` — Lesson packages + booking
- `about.html` — Blair's bio
- `contact.html` — Contact form (opens mail app)
- `style.css` — Styles
- `script.js` — Tiny cart using LocalStorage
- `placeholder.svg` — Simple hero/product placeholder art

## Publish for a real public link
### Option A: GitHub Pages (no server needed)
1. Create a new repo named `username.github.io`.
2. Upload these files to the repo root (no build step needed).
3. Visit `https://username.github.io/` for your live site.

### Option B: Netlify or Vercel
- Drag & drop the folder in their dashboard or connect your repo.
- You'll get a public link like `https://blairs-kitty-kostumes.netlify.app/` (example).

### Custom Domain (optional)
- Buy a domain (e.g., Namecheap).
- Point DNS to GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel and configure in their UI.

## Notes
- The cart is demo-only and "checks out" by composing an email.
- Replace `.example` emails with your real email address.
- You can swap `placeholder.svg` for product photos later.

Have fun, and may your whiskers be unrumpled.
